# Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project

### Summary
I am a data analyst working in the marketing team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to conver casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recoomendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Stakeholders
* **Cyclistic** - A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share inclusive to people with disabiilties and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Lily has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analytics team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differe, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Lily and the team are interested in analytics the historical bike trip to identify trends.
